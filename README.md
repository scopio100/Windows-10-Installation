Upgrade Dell Inspiron 1545 to Win 10 fails
This laptop came with Vista and I was able to upgrade it to Windows 8 Pro and both keys are found in the system by ShowKey Plus
# Windows-10-Installation
Unable to install update to Windows 10
I downloaded Media Creation Tool and run it but it failed half way through “Updating Windows” process with a BSOD “We couldn’t install Windows 10 0xC1900101 – 0x4000D Instalation failed in the Second_Boot phase with error during MIGRATE_DATA operation” The pc reverted to Windows 8.1 Pro.
I run SetupDiag which created a log file as shown below but don’t know where to go from here.

DebugSetupMemoryDump - Found qualifying memory dump during setup, but the debugger binaries were not found. Either examine the memory dump here: C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources\Rollback\setupmem.dmp or install the debugger tools from here: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-hardware/drivers/debugger/ to determine the failure.
Any help will be most appreciated.
